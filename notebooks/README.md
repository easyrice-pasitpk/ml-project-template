Notebook Convention
==============================

Notebook is an effective tool for data exploration and visualization. It can also be a playgroud for experimenting with ideas. However, due to the quick and dirty nature of notebook usage, the development workspace can quickly become messy. Thus, for the sage of collaboration, a naming convention for notebooks has been established.

According to Cookiecutter Data Science, a notebook's name should follow the format below.

<step>-<ghuser>-<description>.ipynb (e.g., 1.1-user-visualize-distribution.ipynb)

Notebook usage can be divided into 7 steps as follows:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data validation
3. Data preparation
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Error analysis
7. Model validation
